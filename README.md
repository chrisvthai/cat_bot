# catpic_bot
## Overview
A Discord chatbot running multiple commands such as displaying server info, but more notably dispenses random cat pics in chat channels.
I got the idea for this from a combination of 
1. I wanted some practice with Javascript, specifically with Node.js
2. I use Discord everyday, and the main Discord I use to communicate with a bunch of my gaming friends is cat-themed for some reason.
So after some quick work, here's a catpic dispenser!

## Commands
A Discord bot typically works by responding to user commands in the form of text messages to Discord chat channels. Here are the
commands currently supported by my lovely catpic-bot.
`!help` Outputs info on how to use the bot.
`!hi` Outputs a hi in response.
`!server` Outputs various information about the current Discord server
`!catpic` Catpics!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Enjoy the catpic dispenser!
