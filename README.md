# cat_bot
## Overview
A Discord chatbot running multiple commands such as displaying server info, but most notably dispenses random cat pics in chat channels.
I got the idea for this from a combination of 
1. I wanted some practice with Javascript, specifically with Node.js
2. I use Discord everyday, and the main Discord I use to communicate with a bunch of my gaming friends is cat-themed for some reason.

Here's an overview of the cat_bot!

## Commands
A Discord bot typically works by responding to user commands in the form of text messages to Discord chat channels. Here are the
commands currently supported by my lovely catpic-bot.  
`!help` Outputs info on how to use the bot.  
`!hi` Outputs a hi in response.  
`!bye` Outputs a bye in response.  
`!server` Outputs various information about the current Discord server.  
`!catpic` Catpics!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Literally just sends a random catpic in its catpic folder, curated by my friends and I.  
`!dict` Look up a word on the Oxford dictionary. Queries the Oxford Dictionaries API.  
`!link` Link a Steam, Blizzard, League of Legends, Fortnite, etc. account to your Discord account. Uses SQLite to accomplish keeping a database. 

Enjoy the bot and its cat pic dispensing capabilities!
